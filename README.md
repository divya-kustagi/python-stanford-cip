# **Python : Stanford's Code In Place**
This repository showcases my learning during Apr-May 2020, when I was a part of [**CS106A - Code in Place**](https://engineering.stanford.edu/news/free-coding-education-time-covid-19), an introductory programming course using the Python language, offered by **Stanford University** during the time of Covid-19.

10,000 students all over the world were shortlisted from 80,000 applications.
In addition to using online resources, we met (via videoconferencing) in a small group, once a week, with someone on the teaching team which comprised of 800+ section leaders throughout the world. 

The course was centered around **engaging assignments**, had **weekly live video sections** which involved concept reviews & sample coding problems and included a **final project**. 
The main objective of this course was to teach students how to program.

**Concepts covered:**
- Control Flow
- Variables and Expressions
- Functions and Decomposition
- Images
- Graphics and Animation
- Lists and Dictionaries
- Text Processing
